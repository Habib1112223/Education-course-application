Firefighters receive their education at the fire academy, police officers get theirs at the police academy, and EMS officials get medical and emergency first aid training from both public and private sources. However, a revolution of sorts has occurred in the provision of education and training in the emergency management profession. Only a few decades ago, emergency management was an outgrowth of the emergency services and a position for which little or no training was provided (nor was it felt that additional training was needed).

                              The advent of emergency management training and education coincided with the creation of FEMA in 1979, which touched off the development of the practice as a profession. At that time, few officials (both within and outside the traditional emergency services) had any background in emergency management, and few people were dedicated to the function even within major city governments. At the nation’s universities, few programs provided even minor degrees or certificates in the field, and only a handful of colleges offered such courses.

                              At first, it was FEMA that defined the profession as one that required specific academic courses and training. FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) became the focus of these efforts. Working with practitioners at select colleges and universities that offered similar programs, FEMA defined the core competencies of emergency management professionals and developed a definition for an “emergency management curriculum.”

                              It was the events of September 11, 2001, however, that truly transformed emergency management training and education. Since then, primarily due to an explosion in funding available and jobs created in the growing emergency management marketplace (both public and private), hundreds of colleges and universities have begun to offer traditional emergency management degrees and certificates. Many private training facilities have opened to meet the expanding training needs of the profession, and traditional emergency services academies have expanded their curriculums to accommodate the growing number of courses required by full-time emergency management professionals.
